# 
When we loop over a list in the traditional way, we can also filter. We do that by adding an if in the loop.
<div><span>Finish the code in the next step to print a list with only the temperatures above 20.</span>
</div>



temperatures = [21, 10, 19, 20, 0, 31, 12]
above_20 = []
for t in __:
    if __ > 20:
        above_20.append(__)
print(above_20)
