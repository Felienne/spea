Print only the positive values in the list saturation using a combination of if and for.

Note that the if is inside the body, and the if itself uses indentation too, so there are two levels of indentation in this program!

saturation = [2, 5, -1, 41, 21, 9, -5]
for s in saturation:
    if __ __ __:
        print(s)
