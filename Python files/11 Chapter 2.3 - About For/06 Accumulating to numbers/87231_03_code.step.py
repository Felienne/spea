Similar to the pattern where we start with an empty list, we can also start with 0 and add values to the 'accumulator'. In the example, the accumulator is called sum.
What do we need to add to sum to get the sum of all numbers in the list (108)?



numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
sum = 0
for n in numbers:
    sum = sum + __
print(sum)
