The first line starts with if, then a condition and then a colon(:). <br>This colon is important, without it, the code will not run.</p><p>Then follows the body. It may consist of one or more line, but all lines need to start with <i>indentation</i>: either a tab character, or a number of spaces. In the examples, we use 4 spaces.</p><p><br></p>",
