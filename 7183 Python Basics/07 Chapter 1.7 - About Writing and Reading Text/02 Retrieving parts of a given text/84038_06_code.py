Try to retrieve the final element of the text data. 

There are two ways toÂ  do this! Do you remember this from the list exercises how you can get the final element in an easier way?

data = "DNA Enzyme: A"
current_enzyme = data[__]
also_current_enzyme = data[__]
assertEqual(current_enzyme, also_current_enzyme)
