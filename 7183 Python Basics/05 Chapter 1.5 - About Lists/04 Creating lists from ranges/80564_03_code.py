Remember how to create a list directly? <span>Create a list in line 1 with them numbers 0 to 5.</span>

Then in line 3 create a range (not a list!) from 0 to 5.

The assertEqual checks if they are the same. Are they?







zero_to_five_list = [__, __, __, __, __]
zero_to_five_range = range(0,__)
assertEqual(zero_to_five_range, zero_to_five_list)
