Compare these two lines:

<span></span>
<pre><code><span>x = abs(-4)   #abs is a function, so we can store the results
</span>y = print(-4)  # can we store the results of print too?</code></pre> 
To fix the code, simply print -4 by changing line 2.


x = abs(-4)   #abs is a function, so we can store the results
y = print(-4)  # can we store the results of print too?
