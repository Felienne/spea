For a SyntaxError, Python can decide straight away if it is wrong. For a name error, however, Python needs to do a bit more work. It needs to decide if there is a function called prnt and check in all existing functions.</p><p>There is no function called prnt, but there could be one! In fact in later lessons we will teach you how to create your own and then you can pick any name.<br><br>This is why we get a NameError, Python has tried all existing names but there is nothing called prnt. This is summarized in the explanation that 'name 'prnt' is not defined.<br><br></p>",
