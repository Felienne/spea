# Sometimes you will want to print a new line character, such that you can print multiple sentences:<div>
</div><div>Hello!</div><div>My name is what?</div><div>
</div><div>You do this with a special character: \n 
</div><div>
</div><div>Like this:</div><div>
</div><div><pre><code>print("Hello!\nMy name is what?")</code></pre>
</div><div>Note there is no space after the \n character. If you add it, a space would appear on the second line (try it!)</div><div>
</div><div>Now you print this:</div><div>
</div><div>Ahem, excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class
For one second?</div>
