# You can print multiple lines using triple double (so using 3 times ") quotes """<div>Even though these are technically six quotes, in Python they are usually called triple quotes.</div><div>
<div><div>For example, you would print these lines:</div><div>
</div><div>Hello!</div><div>Is it me</div><div>You are looking for?
</div><div>
Like this:</div><div>
</div><div><pre><code>print("""Hello!
Is it me
You are looking for?""")</code></pre>
</div><div>Now can you print this?
</div><div>
</div><div>I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile</div></div></div>
print("""__""")
