For example, if we want to create the 3x3 identity matrix, we could use three lists to represent the rows:<div><br></div><div>[1, 0, 0]<br>[0, 1, 0]<br>[0, 0, 1]<div><br></div></div><div>We can then store those three lists, in a list together:</div><div><br></div><div><pre><code>identity_3 = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]</code></pre> <br>This works, but it is not very elegant, with bigger matrices it quickly gets a bit messy.</div><div><br></div><div>You may use this syntax once in the next step, but then we will teach you a nicer way!<br><br></div>",
